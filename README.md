This repository contains an R script for tidying up data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone in the project described here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The process can be started by running run_analysis.R in R. It is assumed that the Samsung data (UCI HAR Dataset) is located (unzipped) in the current working directory. The results of the process can be found in the file mean_measurements.txt

See CodeBook.md for detailed descriptions of the variables, the data, and the transformations that have performed on the data.
